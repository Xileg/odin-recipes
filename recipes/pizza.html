    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1000ml Water</li>
        <li>1600g Flour</li>
        <li>35g Salt</li>
        <li>20g Sugar</li>
        <li>2g active dry yeast</li>
        <li>50g Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the warm water into the pan of a bread machine, sprinkle in the salt, and add the flour to the pan so
            the flour sits on top of the water.</li>
        <li>Make a hole in the top of the flour, and spoon the yeast into the hole.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture sit for 20 minutes to moisten the flour. Set the bread machine to the knead setting, and
            knead the dough for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead in 1/4 cup more flour or as needed, adding the flour
            about 2 tablespoons at a time, to make a wet, sticky, but elastic dough. The dough should be "as soft as a
            baby's bottom." Form the dough into a round shape. </li>
        <li>Wipe the inside of a large bowl with olive oil, and place the round ball of dough into the bowl. Turn the
            dough over a couple of times so the dough picks up a thin coating of oil. Cover with a cloth, and
            refrigerate the dough for 10 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, allow the dough to come to room temperature before rolling out on a floured surface and adding
            toppings as desired. Roll the dough out thin with a thicker edge before adding toppings. </li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone into oven, dust it with a little flour, and preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees
            C). Bake the pizza on the stone in the preheated oven until the bottom of the crust is browned, 6 to 8
            minutes. </li>
    </ol>
